        <h2>Let's Learn Magic: The Gathering</h2>
        <img src="Images/howToPlayHeader.webp">
        <h3>Your Deck is Your Tool</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="mini-header">Building a Deck</p></li>\
            <ul>
                <li><p>Your deck is your toolbox of spells and creatures. A standard deck has a minimum of 60 cards â€“ 
                    you can have a maximum of four copies of any single card (except for basic lands).</p></li>
                <li><p>It's easiest to start by focusing on one or two colors of mana and building a deck with a clear theme 
                    (like a creature rush, or lots of spellcasting).</p></li>

            </ul>
            <li><p class="mini-header">Card Types</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p class="id1"><strong>Lands</strong>: These are your mana sources. You'll need lands to cast almost every other card.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Creatures</strong>: Your creatures are both your attackers and defenders. They are defined by their power 
                    (how much damage they deal) and toughness (how much damage they can take).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sorceries</strong>: These potent spells have a one-time effect and then go to your graveyard (discard pile).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Instants</strong>: These spells can be played in response to other spells or on your opponent's turn, offering flexibility.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Enchantments</strong>: These stay on the battlefield, offering long-term benefits or effects.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Artifacts</strong>: These represent magical equipment and other objects, and usually stay in play.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Planerswalkers</strong>: These powerful cards represent allies you can summon to the battlefield. Each has unique abilities and a 
                    loyalty counter total (like their own life total).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Battles</strong>: These are a very rare card type found on only a small subset of cards, usually depicting epic events with special rules.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sagas</strong>: These are a special type of enchantment. They have "chapters" that trigger effects each turn as you add lore counters. 
                    After the final chapter, the Saga is sacrificed.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>How a Game of Magic Works</h3>
        <img src="Images/turnOrder.png" id="turnOrder">
        <ul>
            <li><p class="mini-header">Game Goal</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p class="id1">You and your opponent each start with 20 life. Your goal is to reduce your opponent's life to zero before they do the same to you.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><p class="mini-header">The Turn, In Order</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p class="id1"><strong>Untap</strong>: Untap any cards you used ("tapped") on your last turn.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Upkeep</strong>: Some cards have special effects that happen during upkeep.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Draw</strong>: Take the top card of your deck into your hand.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Main Phase 1</strong>: Your main time to play lands, creatures, and spells.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Combat</strong>: Declare your attackers, your opponent chooses blockers, and damage is dealt.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Main Phase 2</strong>: Chance to play additional cards if you didn't before combat.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>End Step</strong>: A brief cleanup phase, and then your opponent's turn begins!</p></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example Game</h3>
        <ul>
