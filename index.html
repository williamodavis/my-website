        <h2>Dive into the World of Magic: The Gathering</h2>
        <img src="Images/mtgGame.webp" alt="MTG game in progress">
        <h3>Welcome to a Universe of Strategy and Imagination</h3>
        <p>Magic: The Gathering is a game of endless possibilities, where fantasy worlds collide in spectacular duels.
         As a Planeswalker, you wield a customized deck that's as unique as your playstyle. Whether you thrive on commanding mighty creatures, 
         casting mind-bending spells, or orchestrating clever tactics, there's a path to victory for you.</p>
         <h3>The Building Blocks of Magic</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Lands</strong>: Lands are your fundamental resource, producing mana – the magical energy powering your spells and abilities. 
                Your deck's blend of lands ensures you have the right colors of mana when you need them.</li>
            <li><strong>Creatures</strong>: Creatures are the heart of your army. Summon ferocious beasts, mystical beings, and legendary heroes to 
                attack your opponent or stand firm as defenders.</li>
            <li><strong>Spells</strong>: Change the tide of battle with devastating power. Sorceries and instants offer an array of effects: deal damage, 
                bolster your creatures, counter your opponent's plans, and much more.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Card Types</strong>: Artifacts represent powerful magical equipment and contraptions, enchantments bring lasting effects
                 to the battlefield, and Planeswalkers themselves can enter the fray as mighty allies.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h3>The Flow of a Magic Game</h3>
        <p>Think of a Magic game as a thrilling exchange of moves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Untap</strong>: Start your turn by refreshing your resources. Lands and creatures that were “tapped” (used for mana or to attack)
                 in the previous turn are ready for action again.</li>
            <li><strong>Draw</strong>: Add a fresh card to your hand, bolstering your options.</li>
            <li><strong>Play Lands</strong>: You can play one land per turn, ensuring your mana supply grows.</li>
            <li><strong>Cast Spells</strong>: With mana from your lands, summon creatures, unleash enchantments, or cast a game-changing sorcery.</li>
            <li><strong>Attack</strong>: Send your creatures charging at your opponent. They must use their creatures to block or take damage directly.</li>
            <li><strong>Defend</strong>: If your opponent attacks, use your untapped creatures to form a defensive wall.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Your Path to Victory</h3>
        <p>The goal of Magic is to reduce your opponent's life total from 20 to zero.  Attack with your creatures, unleash powerful spells, and outsmart 
            your opponent at every turn. The strategies are endless - it's up to you to forge your winning formula!</p>
