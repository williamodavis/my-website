I do not currently have any feedback on the discussion(although I will update this page if I do get any). However, I did get some feedback during one of the Zoom classes.
Some feedback that I received there was that the background gradient didn't look quite right, and the contrast of the background colors wasn't the best. I tried messing
around with the gradient and changing the colors of the backgrounds to improve contrast, but it did not look as good as it does right now, in my opinion.
